#### Redis
redis is actually a cache system basicly.

it stores the data that you want at the RAM.
it has instructions as SET, GET, flushall
it stores datas in STRÄ°NG!
and return type as string agin so make shure the data format.. you can Json.Stringfy and return json agin..
Nextjs has a library for redis you can use it at your backend to make it 10 time faster..
expire settings for the key value pairs..
 
you can install the redis nextjs library via 

```
npm i redis
```
